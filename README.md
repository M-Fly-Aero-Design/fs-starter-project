# Flight Systems Starter Project

Hello prospective members :) Follow along this readme to learn about ROS installation, coding your first publisher/subscriber nodes, and git version control. 

## Installing ROS

Go to this link to and follow the instructions to install ROS Humble:
https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation.html

_Note: I would recommend using Linux. I use WSL (which EECS classes also recommend if you have a Windows computer)._

_Note #2: Make sure every ROS documentation tutorial you follow is for ROS HUMBLE. The newest version, Jazzy, is incompatible with our flight computer, the Jetson Nano._

Next, configure your environment: https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials/Beginner-CLI-Tools/Configuring-ROS2-Environment.html
