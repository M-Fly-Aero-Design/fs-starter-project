# Flight Systems Starter Project

Hello prospective members :) Follow along this readme to learn about ROS installation, coding your first publisher/subscriber nodes, and git version control. 

## Installing ROS

Go to this link to and follow the instructions to install ROS Humble:
https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation.html

_Note: Please use Linux. Windows doesn't support using dependencies in ROS. Also, I can help you if you run into any issues, since I use WSL (which EECS classes also recommend if you have a Windows computer)._

_Note #2: Make sure every ROS documentation tutorial you follow is for ROS HUMBLE. The newest version, Jazzy, is incompatible with our flight computer, the Jetson Nano._

Next, configure your environment: https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials/Beginner-CLI-Tools/Configuring-ROS2-Environment.html

To complete setup, install colcon:

- Linux: `sudo apt install python3-colcon-common-extensions`
- macOS: `python3 -m pip install colcon-common-extensions`

## Setting up your workspace

Once you've sourced ROS, you can create a new directory. This will house all of your flight systems code for the year.

`mkdir -p ~/ros2_ws/src`

`cd ~/ros2_ws/src`

Next, clone this repository. (If you don't have git, go on a side quest and install that. https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

`git clone https://github.com/mfly-auton-software/fs-starter-project.git`

`cd fs-starter-project`

Change to a new branch and name it your uniqname: `git checkout -b <your-uniqname>`

## Create a package

A package is an organizational unit for your ROS 2 code. If you want to be able to install your code or share it with others, then youâ€™ll need it organized in a package. With packages, you can release your ROS 2 work and allow others to build and use it easily.

Package creation in ROS 2 uses ament as its build system and colcon as its build tool. We will be using Python to create all of our packages.

Make sure that you are in the correct folder (the repository folder under the workspace src folder). Then, run the following command, which creates a new package named your uniqname:

`ros2 pkg create --build-type ament_python --license Apache-2.0 <your-uniqname>`

## Write a publisher/subscriber

To write your first publisher/subscriber node, follow this tutorial (make sure you're in the Python tab): https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials/Beginner-Client-Libraries/Writing-A-Simple-Py-Publisher-And-Subscriber.html

*Note: You can skip the first step, "Create a package", as you've already done that.* 

*Note #2: They named the package "py_pubsub" so just use common sense and replace that with your uniqname wherever they use it :)*

## Turn in your project!

Take a screenshot of your code running in the terminals successfully and send it to me (Cindy) over slack. Or show me irl. 

Next, create a pull request for your code by pushing to your new branch:

`git add .`

`git commit -m "commit message"`

`git push --set-upstream origin <your-uniqname>`

Navigate to the repository, where you should see a big ol' "Compare & pull request" button. Click it.

Add a title and description. In your description, include the following information:

- Name, grade, major
- What you hope to work on in MFly
- Favorite artist or book or movie (and why). No this definitely isn't me looking for free recommendations
- whatever else you want. it's your PR bro

Click "Create pull request". Then, go to the top right (ish) of the screen and click "Reviewers", then search for my username. Add me as a reviewer. Also ping me on slack because I don't trust GitHub notifs

If you pass all the vibe checks, I will approve your code and merge it. Congratulations and welcome to flight systems :D
